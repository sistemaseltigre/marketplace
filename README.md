## Overview

Destinyofwar is an exciting MMORPG that has been in development since 2021, built on the Solana blockchain. Players embark on epic adventures, defeating enemies, and collecting valuable in-game items. As the founder and lead developer, I've been committed to continuously enhancing the game's features and bringing innovations to the gaming community.

## Marketplace for Encode Summer Hackathon

As part of the Encode Summer Hackathon, we are thrilled to present a new feature for Destinyofwar - a revolutionary blockchain-based marketplace. This marketplace allows players to buy and sell the in-game items they've obtained by defeating enemies, thereby enhancing the in-game economy.

### Marketplace Features

- Secure Transactions: We've integrated the Phantom wallet to ensure secure and seamless transactions for buying and selling items.
- Transparency: All transactions are executed on the Solana blockchain, ensuring transparency and trust within the marketplace.
- User-Friendly Interface: The marketplace boasts a user-friendly interface, catering to both crypto and non-crypto players alike.

### Important Note
